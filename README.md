# Cryptopals (in C)

This can be used as a template.

## Prerequisites:
- a C compiler (gcc, clang etc.) To see if they are already installed, run `which <compiler>`, if it is intalled, a path for where the requested installer is installed will be returned.
    - for gcc (on MacOS): `brew install gcc`
    - for clang (on MacOS): `xcode-select --install` 
- An IDE
    - For VSCode, install the `C/C++` extension
    - If you want to try neovim, let me know and I can help you set it up :)
- git (so you can fork this repo to use as your own)
